Hi!

Welcome to the Dogescript *bloge* (pronounced like *doge*). This soon will be the home of all Dogescript related news.

I'd like to give a huge thanks to [Alexandre Dantas](http://alexdantas.net/) for putting this whole site together. Definitely a lot nicer than the old site! I'm excited for the future of Dogescript, and I can't wait to post more about that soon. Stay tuned.

To the moon!
Zach
